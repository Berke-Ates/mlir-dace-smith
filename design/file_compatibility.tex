\section{File compatibility} \label{file_comp}
In order to maintain metadata that is present in the SDFG every SDIR element has attributes, that describe the said metadata. However only non-default values are saved. The name of the attributes must match the names in the SDFG. See Figure \ref{fig:file_comp}.
