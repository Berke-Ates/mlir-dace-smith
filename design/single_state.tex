\section{Single state}
States are represented by an SSACFG region with the dialect-specific keyword \codeword{sdir.state}. See Figure \ref{fig:state}. The state body contains all the runnable subgraphs. States need to use dialect ops for reading/writing global arrays and can therefore not access them directly.
The op \codeword{sdir.get_access} is used to achieve this. This op is exclusive for the state region and may not be used by sub-regions. See Figure \ref{fig:state_in_out}.
