\subsection{Library nodes}
Since a lossless translation is desired in order to translate back and forth, library nodes don't get expanded before translation. An op called \codeword{sdir.libcall} gets introduced. It works like \codeword{sdir.call} but calls a library function instead. The name of the function matches the specific library function name.
\smc{lib}{Library call}
