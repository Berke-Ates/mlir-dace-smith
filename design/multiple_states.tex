\section{Multiple states} \label{section:multistate}
For multiple states a builtin graph region is used as states can form a cyclic graph. Transitions have either assignments or conditions. Both are implemented with the \codeword{sdir.edge} op using the \codeword{assign} and \codeword{condition} attributes. See Figure \ref{fig:multistate}.
