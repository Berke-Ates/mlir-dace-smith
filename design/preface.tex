\section{Preface}
This document explains the representation of SDFG concepts in a MLIR dialect called SDIR (Stateful Dataflow Intermediate Representation). The goals were to constrain the supported SDFGs as little as possible, to stay as MLIR-esque as possible (to enable the use of MLIR tools) and to be as lossless as possible (a round-trip should result in the provided input). 
Keep in mind, that the shown code snippets have been adjusted to focus on the corresponding concept and to save space. Especially op types have been mostly omitted. \codeword{\%0} and \codeword{\%1} are used as constant zeros and ones. Comments regarding errors are welcome.\\
